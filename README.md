# RHIZO
RHIZO: The decentralized knowledge graph. We use game theory and logic-staking to fix the broken incentives of social media. Native to the AT Protocol.

# RHIZO 🧠

**A Trust-Based Knowledge Network for the Open Web.**

> "The strongest connection in the universe isn't a like – it's a verified argument."

## 🌍 The Mission
[cite_start]Rhizo is an attempt to fix the "Networking Problem" of modern social media[cite: 35]. Instead of optimizing for engagement (clicks/rage), we optimize for **truth and logical consistency**.

[cite_start]We are building a **meta-layer** over the existing web [cite: 1462] [cite_start]that allows users to connect ideas, validate arguments, and visualize discourse as a persistent **rhizomatic graph** [cite: 529] instead of a fleeting feed.

## ✨ Core Concepts

* **🌱 Rhizomatic Structure:** No central authority. [cite_start]Information grows horizontally in a decentralized graph based on the **AT Protocol**[cite: 11, 50].
* **⚖️ Logic over Likes:** Connections between nodes are semantic (`supports`, `refutes`, `extends`). [cite_start]High-stakes claims require "Skin in the Game" (Staking) to prevent spam[cite: 26, 350].
* **🛡️ Privacy by Default:** Rhizo is **local-first** software. [cite_start]Your thoughts belong to you (in your Personal Data Server) until you explicitly choose to publish them[cite: 1471, 1479].
* [cite_start]**🤖 Mediator AI:** An integrated AI agent acts as a librarian and conflict mediator, checking for logical fallacies and redundant content before it hits the network[cite: 24, 118].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Genesis Phase)

* **Protocol:** [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) (Bluesky ecosystem)
* [cite_start]**Identity:** Decentralized Identity (`did:plc`) + Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Humanity[cite: 91, 181].
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** Local-first Web App (HTML5/Canvas/Vis.js for prototyping)[cite: 66, 76].
* [cite_start]**Search:** Vector Embeddings for semantic proximity[cite: 116].

## 🚀 Current Status: Genesis

[cite_start]We are currently in the **Pre-Start / Prototyping Phase**[cite: 41].
[cite_start]The code in this repository represents the "Genesis" prototype – a high-fidelity simulation of the Rhizo experience[cite: 46].

## 🤝 Contributing

We are looking for thinkers, coders, and game theorists.
